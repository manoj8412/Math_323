\section{Fundamentals}
\subsection{Set Theory}

	\begin{defn}
		A \textbf{set} is a collection of objects, called elements.
	\end{defn}
	\begin{exmp}
		The set of natural numbers $\N = \{ 1, 2, 3, \dots\}$, which is both infinite and countable.
	\end{exmp}
	\begin{exmp}
		The set of all McGill students.
	\end{exmp}
	\begin{defn}
		Let $X$ be a set. A \textbf{subset} is another set $A$ such that every element of $A$ is in $X$ as well:
		$$ A = \{ x: x \in X\} \quad \text{ or } \quad x \in A \implies x \in X$$
	\end{defn}
	\begin{rem}
		The empty set is denoted $\varnothing = \{\}$
	\end{rem}
	\begin{defn}
		An \textbf{intersection} between the sets A and B is defined as
		$$ A \cap B = x \in A \quad \text{and}\quad x \in B$$
	\end{defn}
	\begin{defn}
		A \textbf{union} between the sets A and B is defined as
		$$ A \cup B = x \in A \quad \text{or}\quad x \in B$$
	\end{defn}
	\begin{defn}
		Let $X$ be a universal set with a subset $A$. Then the complement of $A$ with respect to $X$ is
		$$ A^c = X \setminus A = \{ x: x \in X \quad \text{and} \quad x \notin A \}$$
	\end{defn}
	\begin{exmp}
		$\mathcal{P} (B) = \{ A: A \subseteq B \}$ (all subsets of $B$)
		
		Let $B = \{1,2,3\}$, then
		$$ \mathcal{P}(B) = \bigg\{ \underbrace{ \{\}, \{1,2,3\}}_{\text{trivial subsets}}, \underbrace{\overbrace{\{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\},}^{\text{singletons}} \overbrace{\{1,2\}, \{1,3\}, \{2,3\}}^{\text{doubles}}}_{\text{proper subsets}} \bigg\}$$
	\end{exmp}
	\begin{defn}
		Two sets $A$ and $B$ are denoted as \textbf{disjoint} whenever they share no elements, i.e. they have nothing in common:
		$$ A \cap B = \varnothing$$ 
	\end{defn}
	\begin{exmp}
		Let $\Omega = \N = \{ 0,1,2,3,4,\dots\}$ and $A \subseteq N = \{ n \in \N: n \text{ is even}\}$. Then,
		$$ A^c = \{ n \in \N : n \text{ is odd}\}$$
	\end{exmp}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item $A \cap \varnothing = \varnothing$
			\item $A \cup \varnothing = A$
			\item $A \cup B = B \cup A$
			\item $A \cap B = B \cap A$
			\item $(A\cap B)\cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)$
			\item $(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)$
			\item $(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$
			\item $(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$
		\end{itemize}
	\end{multicols}
	\begin{exe}
		Prove that
		\begin{enumerate}[$\quad \quad$a)]
			\item $A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$
			\item $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{exe}
	\begin{note}
		Consider $A \setminus B = \{ x\in A: x \notin B \}$. Then we define the \textbf{exclusive or} as
		$$ A \setminus B \cup B \setminus A = A \triangle B$$

\section{Probability}
	Probability is the branch of applied mathematics that deals with random events, which are non-deterministic in nature, unlike calculus for instance, which deals with deterministic events.
	\begin{exmp}
		Toss a coin. We won't know the outcome of the toss, but we do know that the outcome will be either \emph{heads} or \emph{tails}.
	\end{exmp} 
	\begin{exmp}
		Roll a die. We now have several outcomes, depending on the number of faces on the die.
	\end{exmp}
	\begin{defn}
		Given a random experiment, the set of all possible outcomes is denoted $\Omega$, and is called the \textbf{sample space}.
	\end{defn}
	\begin{exmp} $\quad$ \\
		\vspace{-0.5cm}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The sample space for a coin toss is $\Omega = \{ H, T \}$
			\item The sample space for a rolled 6-face die is $\Omega = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$
			\item The sample space for a coin toss where we require heads once is $\Omega = \{ H, TH, TTH, \dots \}$
		\end{itemize}
	\end{exmp}
	\begin{defn}
		Let $\Omega$ denote the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.
		\begin{enumerate}[$\quad\,\,${2.2}.1.]
			\item An \textbf{elementary event} is a subset of $\Omega$ with a singular element (i.e. one single outcome) and is also an element of $\mathcal{P}(\Omega)$.
			\item A \textbf{compound event} is any subset of $\Omega$ (including the elementary events).
			\item An \textbf{event} is any element of $\Omega$.
			\item $\varnothing$ denotes \textbf{impossible events}.
			\item A \textbf{complimentary event} given an event $A$ is denoted $A^c$.
			\item Given 2 events $A$ and $B$, where $A \cap B = \varnothing$, we denote them as \textbf{disjoint events}.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{defn}
	\begin{defn}
		Let $\Omega$ be the sample space attached to a random experiment. A \textbf{probability} is a function $P$ such that
		$$ P: \mathcal{P}(\Omega) \to [0,1]$$
	\end{defn}
	Note that $P(\Omega)=1$. Given a sequence $A_1, \dots, A_n, \dots$, of pairwise disjoint events ($A_i \cap A_j = \varnothing \quad \forall i \neq j$), we have that 
	$$ P \left(  \bigcup_{i =1} A_i\right) = \sum_{i =1} P (A_i)$$
	\begin{rem}
		In general, if $\Omega$ is countable, then it is enough to define $P$ on the elementary event, as every other event can be written as a union.
	\end{rem}
	\begin{exmp}
		Toss a coin such that $\Omega = \{ H, T \}$. A probability on $\Omega$ is completely given by $p \in [0,1]$, and the assignment of $P(\{H\}) = p$, and $P(\{T\}) = 1-p$.
	\end{exmp}
	\begin{rem}
		If $p=1/2$ in the previous example, then $P(\{H\}) = P(\{T\}) = 1/2$, implying that \emph{the coin is fair/balanced}.
	\end{rem}
	\begin{exmp}
		Throw a die such that $\Omega = \{ \omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3, \omega_4, \omega_5, \omega_6 \}$. A probability on $\Omega$ is given by 6 non-negative integers $p_i$ where $i=1,2,3,4,5,6$, such that
		$$ p_i = P(\{w_i\}) \geq 0$$
		And so
		$$ \sum_{i=1}^6 p_i = 1$$
		Therefore, if we consider the die to be fair, we have $p_i = 1/6 \quad \forall i \in \{ 1,2,3,4,5,6 \}$. \\ Let $A = \{ \omega_1, \omega_3\}$ Then
		\begin{align*}
		 A &= \{ \omega_1\} \cup \{ \omega_3 \} \implies P(A) \\ 
		 &= P(\{ \omega_1 \}) + P(\{ \omega_3 \}) \\
		 &= 1/6 + 1/6 \\
		 &= 1/3
		\end{align*} 
	\end{exmp}
	\begin{exe}
		Consider a die such that the probability $P(\{\omega_i\})$ is proportional to $k$ such that
		$$ P \big( \{\omega_i\} \big) = ck$$
		Therefore:
		\begin{align*}
			1 &= \sum_{k=1}^6 P(\{\omega_k\}) \\
			&= \sum_{k=1}^6 ck \\
			&= c\sum_{k=1}^6 k \\
			&= c\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\bigg|_{n=6} \\
			&= c \frac{6 \times 7}{2} \\
			&= 21c\\
		\intertext{ }
			\therefore c &= \frac{1}{21}
		\end{align*}
		
		What would be the probability of an even number?\\
		Let $A = \{ \omega_2, \omega_4, \omega_6 \}$, and so
		\begin{align*}
			P(A) &= P(\{\omega_2\}) + P(\{\omega_4\}) + P(\{\omega_6\})  \\
			&= \frac{2+4+6}{21} \\
			&= \frac{12}{21}
		\end{align*}
		
		What would be the probability of an odd number?\\
		Simple:
		\begin{align*}
			P(B) &= 1- P(A) \\
			&= \frac{9}{12}
		\end{align*}
